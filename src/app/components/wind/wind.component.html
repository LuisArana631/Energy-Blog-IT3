    <h2>Definition</h2>

    <p class="parrafo">
      Wind is caused by the uneven heating of the atmosphere by the sun, variations in the earth's surface, and rotation of the earth. Mountains, bodies of water, and vegetation all influence wind flow patterns. Wind turbines convert the energy in wind to electricity by rotating propeller-like blades around a rotor. The rotor turns the drive shaft, which turns an electric generator. Three key factors affect the amount of energy a turbine can harness from the wind: wind speed, air density, and swept area.<br><br>
      Wind energy (or wind power) describes the process by which wind is used to generate electricity. Wind turbines convert the kinetic energy in the wind into mechanical power. A generator can convert mechanical power into electricity. Mechanical power can also be utilized directly for specific tasks such as pumping water.<br><br>
      According to IRENA's latest data, the production of wind electricity in 2016 accounted for 6% of the electricity generated by renewables. Many parts of the world have strong wind speeds, but the best locations for generating wind power are sometimes remote ones. Offshore wind power offers tremendous potential wind energy graph worldwide

    <h2>How does the system work or generates energy?</h2>
    <hr>
    <p class="parrafo">
      Wind turbines harness the wind as a clean, free, and widely available renewable energy source to generate electric power.
    </p>
    <ul class="parrafo">
      <li>
        <b>Wind Power Plant:</b> wind power plants produce electricity by having an array of wind turbines in the same location. The placement of a wind power plant is impacted by factors such as wind conditions, the surrounding terrain, access to electric transmission and other siting considerations. In a utility scale wind pant ,each turbine generates electricity which runs to a substation where it transfers to the grid where it powers our communities. The wind power plant is transported to the substation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Substation:</b> a substation links the transmission system to the distribution system that delivers electricity to the community. Within the substation,transformer converter electricity from high voltages to lower voltages which can the be delivered safely to electricity consumers
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Transmission Tower:</b> transmission lines carry electricity at high voltages over long distances from wind turbines and other energy generators to areas where that energy is needed
      </li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Advantages</h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="parrafo">
          Harnessing wind to generate energy has its advantages and is an efficient option for many different parts of the world since it doesn’t depend on direct sunlight exposure like solar energy
        </p>
        <ul class="parrafo">
          <li> Free fuel </li>
          <li> One of the cleanest forms of energy </li>
          <li> Advances in technology </li>
          <li> Doesn’t disrupt farmland operations </li>
          <li> Reduces our dependence of fossil fuels </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="parrafo">
          Although wind energy is a renewable, greener option of energy, it still has its disadvantages and limitations.
        </p>
        <ul class="parrafo">
          <li> Dangerous to some wildlife </li>
          <li> Noisy </li>
          <li> Expensive upfront cost </li>
          <li> Unreliable/Unpredictable </li>

    <h2>Current situation in Guatemala</h2>
    <hr>
    <p class="parrafo">
      In Guatemala there are two regions with winds that can produce wind energy: the region of the departments of Escuintla and Guatemala, around the Pacaya volcano, and the eastern part of the department of Jutiapa, on the border with El Salvador, so it is not by chance This is where the wind power plants are installed. The first plant was “Eólico San Antonio El Sitio”, with an installed capacity of 52.8 MW, located in Villa Canales, department of Guatemala, which began operations in April 2015. The next one is “Viento Blanco”, located in the municipality of San Vicente, Escuintla, around the Pacaya volcano, with an installed capacity of 23.1 MW, and has been operating since December 2015. The most recent is the “Las Cumbres” plant, which has a capacity of 31.5 MW, and is located in the municipality of Agua Blanca, Jutiapa. The total installed capacity as a whole is 106.5 MW, with an energy production in 2019 of 330 GWh, representing 2.47% of the total generation in that year. Wind energy in Guatemala is an achievement of the policy of diversification of the energy matrix. The construction and installation of these plants was made possible by having been awarded with contracts within the long-term power purchase tenders for end users, carried out by the distributors and the National Electric Power Commission.
