    <h2>Definition, How hydropower works?</h2>
    <hr>
    <p class="parrafo">
      A typical hydroelectric plant is a system with three parts: a power plant where the electricity is produced, a dam that can be opened or closed to control water flow, and a reservoir where water is stored. The water behind the dam flows through an intake and pushes against blades in a turbine, causing them to turn. The turbine spins a generator to produce electricity.<br><br>
      The amount of electricity that can be generated depends on how far the water drops and how much water moves through the system. The electricity can be transported through long-distance electric lines to homes, factories, and businesses. Other types of hydropower plants make use of the flow through a waterway without a dam.<br><br>
      Hydropower is called renewable source of energy because it uses and not consumes the water for generation of electricity, and the hydropower leaves this vital resource available for other uses.<br><br>

    <h2>What are the elements of a hydropower?</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The major elements of a hydropower are:</p>
    <ul class="parrafo">
      <li>Dam/Barrage</li>
      <li>Head works i.e. power intake, head regulator and desilting chambers etc.</li>
      <li>Head race tunnels/channels</li>
      <li>Surge shaft/surge chambers</li>
      <li>Pressure shaft/Penstock</li>
      <li>Underground and surface power house</li>
      <li>Tailrace channel or tailrace tunnel</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Usages</h2>
    <hr>
    <p class="parrafo">
      Usually, the electricity generated in hydropower plants is discharged into the general grid. For industries in certain sectors –chemicals, steel, paper, textiles, cement, etc.–, with a high consumption of electricity, it is convenient for them to have their own mini-hydropower, since all the energy is used in the production process.<br><br>
      The ideal situation is an interconnection with the electricity grid since it improves the electrical balance between production and demand of the installation and allows the excess generated to be sold during the hours when the plant is stopped.

        <h2>Advantages</h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="parrafo">
          Hydropower is a renewable, economic, non polluting and environmentally benign source of energy. It saves scarce fossil fuel resources of the country, which are non renewable. Hydropower projects have certain distinctive advantages over other sources of electricity generation, as discussed below:
        </p>
        <ul class="parrafo">
          <li> <b>Technical Benefits: </b>
             <ul>
               <li>Hydropower projects are known to have much longer life and provide cheaper electricity as there is no fuel cost and the recurring cost involved in generation, operation and maintenance is lower than that in case of other sources of energy.</li>
             </ul>
          </li>
          <li> <b>Environmental Benefits: </b>
            <ul>
              <li>Uses renewable and pollution free source i.e water</li>
              <li>Increase in Agriculture Productivity through development of irrigation and multipurpose schemes, having generation of electricity as one of the objectives, wherever possible and feasible.</li>
              <li>Avoided Green House Gas (GHG) emissions from equivalent thermal and other fuel based power projects.</li>
              <li>Flood Mitigation through large storage dams.</li>
              <li>Source of Drinking Water</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li> <b>Social Benefits: </b>
          <ul>
            <li>Hydro projects are a boon to the society and the population in and around the projects. With enhanced employment opportunities, increased earnings, enriched life style and improved standard of living, the people in these localities experience an economic and social upliftment.</li>
          </ul>
       </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
        <hr>
        <ul class="parrafo">
          <li> <b>Has negative environmental consequences.</b> Despite having many positive aspects, it must be taken into account that the construction of hydroelectric plants generates changes in the ecosystem, seriously affecting animals and plants, as well as water quality.  </li>
          <li> <b>May be affected by droughts.</b> It is true that it does not depend on rain on a daily basis, but seasons with many droughts can be a real impediment when it comes to generating electricity in this way. </li>
          <li> <b>It is difficult to find the right place.</b> It is necessary that it has the adequate orography and it is dependent on the water course so that you can get the most out of the terrain. </li>
          <li> <b>Setting up the hydroelectric plant is expensive.</b> As we said, it is an advantage that in the long run hydraulic energy is very cheap, but the investment to build the plant is very high. In addition, on many occasions, it will require the expropriation of land with the cost of compensation that this entails.</li>

    <h2>Current situation in Guatemala</h2>
    <hr>
    <p class="parrafo">
      Guatemala has almost 1,500 MW of installed hydropower capacity, making up 41 per cent of the country’s overall energy production. Hydropower plays an important role in meeting ambitious targets for renewable energy generation. Over the past 10 years, energy consumption from renewable sources has doubled with generation representing between 65 per cent and 70 per cent of national consumption.<br><br>
      Guatemala’s hydraulic resources have the potential to add roughly 11 GW of hydropower capacity, of which roughly 6 GW is technically exploitable according to the Energy Ministry. However, the country continues to face a challenging environment for new hydropower development due to legal obstacles and high crime rates. Guatemala currently has 39  hydropower
